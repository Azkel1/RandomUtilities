# DateTime Picker
This library is designed to provide a customizable date-time picker that not only works, but is consistent on all browsers and devices.

## TODO

- [X] Create the timepicker
- [ ] Create the month select view
- [ ] Create the year select view
- [X] Make the picker show on focus and auto-dismiss on blur
- [ ] Make the picker position-aware, moving to avoid being off-screen
- [X] Don't change the date on click, instead change it when a OK button is pressed
