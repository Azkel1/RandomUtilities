# Mock API
This is a typescript mock API created using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) and [faker.js](https://github.com/faker-js/faker).

Inside the `generate-data.ts` file is where the example data is generated in case you want to modify it. 

To run this project clone it and run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies and `pnpm start` to start the server.
To regenerate the data run `pnpm regenerate` (the server will auto-start when finished).
